## My humble dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many dotfiles like them, but these ones are
mine

### Setup
```shell
# Clone the repository and move in to the directory
git clone git@github.com:lukerollans/dotfiles.git
cd ~/dotfiles

# Use rcup to install
rcup

# Run vim setup script which will do the first plugin install
sh vim/setup.sh
```

Now you're cooking with gas
